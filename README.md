# Welcome to Live Chat Project

It is a live instant messaging application, with authorization and a simple frontend client. 

## Technical Description
The Backend has been built with Node JS, Express, and SocketIO. The database is MongoDB and managed with Mongoose. The entire authorization is based on Auth0 and React was used on the frontend. Docker and docker-compose were used to containerize both applications.

## Usage
### Start Application
Navigate to the root folder of the project and run the command below,

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The node server will be running on port 8080.

The react application will be running on port 3000. 


Thank you
